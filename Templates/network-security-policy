4.2 IT Department 
a. The IT department shall be responsible for the configuration, management, and monitoring of [Client]'s network infrastructure. 
b. The IT department shall conduct regular network security assessments, vulnerability scans, and penetration tests to identify and address security weaknesses. 


4.3 Users 
a. Users shall comply with this policy and follow network security best practices, including the appropriate use of network resources and reporting of any suspected security incidents.
