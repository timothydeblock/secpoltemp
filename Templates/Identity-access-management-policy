Identity Access Management (IAM) Policy 


Purpose  
The purpose of this Identity Access Management (IAM) policy is to establish guidelines and procedures for managing user identities, access privileges, and authentication mechanisms within [CLIENT]. This policy ensures that only authorized individuals have access to company resources, systems, and data, while also maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. 
Scope  
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals who have access to [CLIENT]' information systems, applications, and data. 
 
Policy Statements  
3.1 User Identity and Access Provisioning 
a. User Provisioning: User accounts shall be created for authorized individuals based on their roles and responsibilities within the organization. Accounts shall be provisioned promptly upon the individual's onboarding. 
b. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Access privileges shall be granted based on the principle of least privilege, using RBAC. Access rights will be assigned to users based on their job roles and responsibilities. 
c. Access Reviews: Periodic access reviews shall be conducted to ensure that access privileges align with users' current job functions. These reviews shall be performed at least annually or whenever there is a change in user roles. 


3.2 User Authentication 
a. Strong Passwords: Users shall be required to create and maintain strong passwords that meet defined complexity requirements. Passwords should be changed regularly and not reused. 
b. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): MFA shall be implemented for all accounts accessing sensitive systems, applications, and data. MFA mechanisms may include hardware tokens, software tokens, SMS-based codes, or biometrics. 
c. Account Lockout: Account lockout mechanisms shall be implemented to prevent unauthorized access through brute force attacks. After a defined number of unsuccessful login attempts, the account shall be temporarily locked. 
d. Account Termination: User accounts shall be promptly deactivated upon termination or when individuals no longer require access to company resources. 


3.3 Access Control 
a. Need-to-Know Principle: Users shall only be granted access to resources and data that are necessary to perform their job functions. 
b. Least Privilege: Access privileges shall be granted at the minimum level required to carry out job responsibilities. Regular access reviews shall be conducted to ensure privileges are still necessary. 
c. Separation of Duties: Sensitive tasks and functions shall require multiple individuals to perform. This ensures that no single user has complete control over critical processes. 
d. Privileged Access Management (PAM): Privileged accounts shall be monitored, audited, and subject to stricter controls, including enhanced authentication, session recording, and time-limited access. 


3.4 User Training and Awareness 
a. Security Awareness Training: Users shall receive regular training on IAM best practices, password security, social engineering, and the importance of protecting access credentials. 
b. Reporting Suspicious Activity: Users shall be educated on how to identify and report suspicious activities or potential security incidents promptly. 


3.5 Monitoring and Auditing 
a. Log Monitoring: Logs related to user access, authentication events, and privilege changes shall be regularly monitored and reviewed for potential security incidents. 
b. Regular Audits: Periodic audits shall be conducted to assess the effectiveness of IAM controls, including user account reviews, access logs, and compliance with policies and regulations. 

Responsibilities 
4.1 Management 
a. Management shall ensure the implementation and enforcement of this IAM policy. 
b. Management shall provide necessary resources for IAM controls, including technology, training, and personnel. 

4.2 IT Department

a. Users shall comply with this IAM policy and report any suspected security breaches or incidents promptly. 
b. Users shall follow password creation guidelines and handle their access credentials securely. 


Policy Compliance 
Non-compliance with this IAM policy may result in disciplinary action, including but not limited to termination of employment, legal action, or revocation of system access privileges. 

Policy Review 
This IAM policy shall be reviewed annually or as deemed necessary to ensure its effectiveness and relevance in protecting [CLIENT]' information assets and resources.
